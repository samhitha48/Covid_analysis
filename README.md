For my understanding, I have taken a dataset and have compared the accuracy rates 
for logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest.
The data set was used to evaluate the considered algorithms and to determine the 
one offering the best accuracy.

Looking at the accuracy rates, we can say that the Random forest model is the most 
accurate one and is said so in the paper “Random Forests and Decision Trees” by 
Jehad Ali, Rehanullah Khan, Nasir Ahmad, Imran Maqsood.

It can be concluded that the Random Forest achieves increased
classification performance and yields results that are accurate and precise in the 
cases of a large number of instances. These scenarios also cover the missing values
problem in the datasets and thus besides accuracy, it also overcomes the overfitting problem generated due to missing values in the datasets. Therefore, for the
classification problems, if one has to choose a classifier among the tree-based 
classifiers set, it is recommended to use the Random Forest with confidence for a 
variety of classification problems
